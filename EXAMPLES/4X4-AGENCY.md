# 4x4 Dashboard - Strategic Goals & Weekly Checklist

A simple, actionable framework to prioritize and track engineering tasks. Focus on alignment, transparency, continuous improvement, and increasing clarity for everyone.

---

## 1. Strategic Backlog
**Maximum of 4 items. Focus on long-term goals and impactful improvements.**

1. - [ ] Deliver final designs for Client Zebra's website
2. - [ ] Develop reusable components for faster future projects
3. - [ ] Improve handoff process between design and development teams
4. - [ ] Conduct user testing sessions for Client Elephant's prototype

---

## 2. Current Week
**Active tasks for the week. Maximum of 4 items.**

- [x] Finalize homepage design for Client X
- [ ] Build responsive navigation and footer components
- [ ] Create style guide documenting colors, type, and spacing
- [ ] Incorporate stakeholder feedback on wireframes (round 2)

---

## 3. Previous Week
**Review completed, deferred, or blocked tasks from the prior week.**

- [x] Conduct stakeholder interviews for Client X
- [x] Create wireframes for key pages
- [ ] Address feedback on initial designs - Deferred (client delayed review by 4 days)
- [x] Set up project repository and folder structure

---

## 4. Recent Lessons Learned
**Capture insights to improve processes and avoid repeating mistakes.**

1. Client changed the hero section 3 times — get sign-off on mood board before moving to high-fidelity next time.
2. Wireframe review was delayed because we sent a Figma link with no walkthrough — schedule a 15-min call with deliverables going forward.
3. Navigation component was built from scratch again; pull last quarter's into a shared library this sprint.
4. Dev handoff missed responsive breakpoints — add a breakpoint checklist to the design QA template.

- Limit each section to 4 items maximum to maintain focus
- Capture lessons learned immediately while they're fresh
- Link to detailed tasks in your project management tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
