# 4x4 Dashboard - Strategic Goals & Weekly Checklist

## Who is this for?
This framework is designed for engineering teams and project managers who struggle with overwhelming backlogs, unclear priorities, and the constant tension between strategic work and urgent firefighting. If your team juggles too many initiatives at once or loses sight of what truly matters, the 4x4 Dashboard brings structured simplicity to your planning process.

## What is this document used for?
The 4x4 Dashboard serves as a simple, actionable framework to prioritize and track engineering tasks. It provides a structured approach with three key sections:
- **Strategic Backlog**: Up to 4 long-term goals that drive meaningful impact
- **Current Week**: 4 active tasks with built-in capacity for urgent issues
- **Previous Week**: A retrospective view to celebrate wins and learn from blockers
- **Improve context switching**: In a perfect world, you wouldn't have to switch context. Our framework helps to minimize  concurrent priorities mean deeper focus and better quality work

This constraint-based approach forces tough prioritization decisions upfront, preventing the paralysis of endless to-do lists.

## Why does it solve problems?
By limiting the number of tasks and emphasizing clarity, the 4x4 Dashboard helps teams:
- **Cut through the noise**: Focus on what actually moves the needle instead of managing sprawling backlogs
- **Build sustainable pace**: Reserve capacity for the inevitable urgent issues without derailing your strategic work
- **Increase visibility**: Everyone knows what's happening, what's next, and why it matters
- **Drive accountability**: Clear commitments make it easier to track progress and celebrate achievements


The "4" constraint isn't arbitrary—it's the sweet spot between ambition and achievability. Enough to make real progress, focused enough to actually finish things.

## Getting Started

Ready to implement the 4x4 Dashboard? Here's how to get started in 3 simple steps:

### Step 1: Copy the Template
Download or copy the [4X4.md](4X4.md) template file to your project repository. Update the metadata at the top (client, repo, week_of, sprint) to match your team's context.

### Step 2: Populate Your First Dashboard
- **Strategic Backlog**: List up to 4 long-term goals or improvements that will have the biggest impact on your project
- **Current Week**: Choose 4 tasks to focus on this week. Consider reserving 1-2 slots for urgent issues if your team frequently handles hotfixes
- **Previous Week**: Leave this blank for your first week, then use it going forward to track what you accomplished
- **Lessons Learned**: Start capturing insights immediately—what's slowing you down? What's working well?

### Step 3: Make It a Habit
- **Weekly Review**: Every Monday (or your team's sprint start), move "Current Week" to "Previous Week" and plan your new week
- **Daily Updates**: Check off completed tasks and adjust as needed
- **Monthly Reflection**: Review your Strategic Backlog and update priorities based on what you've learned

**Pro Tip**: Keep this document in your repository root or link it from your main README so it's always visible to the team.

## FAQ

### Why are there hard 4 long term goals and 4 short term task constraints? Isn't that too little?
Our goal isn't to include all your weekly tasks and long-term goals. This system is designed to help you stay focused on the meaningful and high-impact goals. The constraint forces you to identify what truly matters, rather than spreading attention across everything at once.

### Can I add more than 4 tasks per section?
Yes, of course, but the more you add, the higher the risk of competing tasks and reduced clarity.

### How do I use this with Project Management apps like GitHub, Jira, Slack, etc?
This is not meant to replace any of these tools. Our goal is to provide "right now clarity"—what are we doing this week? The 4x4 Dashboard complements your existing tools by surfacing the most critical priorities from your broader project management system.

We suggest adding a GH issue or PR # at the end of each task.

### How often should I be updating 4X4.md? Every day? Every week?
We recommend updating the 4X4 Dashboard weekly during your sprint planning session. Daily updates are encouraged to check off completed tasks and make adjustments as needed, ensuring it remains a living document.

## Suggestion
We recommend updating the `BACKLOG.md` or `4X4.md` file into the `DEVELOPMENT` branch or the most active branch in your repository to ensure alignment with your team's workflow.
